# Sketches
A repository of sketch's of miniature apps and functions
This is a start for our master sketch workspace, and will be done mostly in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS
I'm focused on learning the use of this new tool to learn to publish changes with Source Control Management (SCM)
Hopefully I'll gain a better understanding and be able to work with multiple contributors

This would be a great start to learning to use this tool on a development team
